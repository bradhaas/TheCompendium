A day came when the regular routine - the smiling faces of passers-by, tradesmen and crafters at their work, farmers tilling the fields - came to a crashing end. A great beast attacked your land and your people, and the best and bravest among you were cut down with such unbridled ferocity that many fled, and those that remained believed your final doom had arrived in the form of an array of gnashing fangs and baleful eyes.</em></p><p>As the bearer of this unfortunate reputation, what specific moment or event did you decide to finally leave the place of your birth and livelihood? How have you come to deal with the insistence of total strangers that you are a hero worthy of praise, even should you insist that you aren&rsquo;t? Do you desire to ultimately set the record straight? Do you wish to escape to a land where you can finally be free of this nuisance? Or, perhaps, have you come to enjoy and even revel in the misconception, embellishing the existing tales as it suits your own needs, actively exploiting the fable to further your own ends?</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps monster hunter is a title you take as a humble hunter of the plethora of things outside the normal range of beasts. The world has more than just bears and owls and basic creatures. There are horrid and fantastical things that require more training and expertise to trap and kill, and that is when those with your skills are called upon. You are not a hero of any special kind. You could just be some average joe doing their job like an exterminator. Sometimes the job may call for you to go elsewhere to pursue the quarry. Some monster hunters are grown from traditional practices, making them skilled in knowing how to use parts of monsters themselves to fashion things like weapons or even harvest their poisons for use.</p><a href=#feature><h2 id=feature><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Feature</h2></a><p>Pick one of the following</p><a href=#feature-poison-purveyor><h3 id=feature-poison-purveyor><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Feature: Poison Purveyor</h3></a><p>Long have you immersed yourself in the meticulous study of the vile humors extracted from monsters of every stripe, and in so doing, have learned both how to carefully preserve and transport the quantities you obtain, and how to peddle your wares to the most interested and higher-paying clientele. You can readily recall the names and types of poisons and admixtures that can be created from the varieties of monster you hunt, and what quantities of given fluids and powders are needed to create such items.</p><a href=#alternate-feature-trophy-taker><h3 id=alternate-feature-trophy-taker><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Alternate Feature: Trophy Taker</h3></a><p>You know how to get the most out of your prey and know what parts you can sell for money and how to collect them (meat, pelts, antlers, heads, claws, teeth, venom, special components, and so on), as well as who would most interested in buying them, allowing you to sell them for twice their normal value. You also know how to harvest and preserve any of these parts from a creatures corpse.</p><a href=#alternate-feature-hunter-senses><h3 id=alternate-feature-hunter-senses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Alternate Feature: Hunter Senses</h3></a><p>You are well adapted with your senses to pick up the traces of quarry, be it through their scat or tracks.

At the same time, many are attracted to the job, blending that rare mix of muscle and shrewd intellect that form the best (and wealthiest) of their profession.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d8</th><th>Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I often find myself mimicking the sounds and speech of animals and monstrosities alike, consciously or not.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I have pursued and immersed myself in the habits of my quarry so often that I have adopted some of their behaviors.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I value the wildlife and natural world only insofar as it is valuable to me dealing with the merchant guilds.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I am as predatory in a market exchange hawking my wares as the beasts I stalk, seeking the best price and the meekest buyer.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>It is less for the profit that I do this than it is for the thrill of the hunt and victory.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I have learned that the most successful hunt is the one that involves skilled allies.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>It is not everyone that deserves to purchase what I procure, and I limit my offerings only to a select few.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>If you cannot keep up with me on a hunt, then you are only as good as bait for my prey.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Ecology</strong> I take only what is needed to quell threats and subsist.
