As the High Wizard of Waterdeep, she is charged with using all the magic and resources at her disposal to defend the city against threats. She was handpicked for the job by Khelben Arunsun, and wields the [[Blackstaff]] from which Khelben derived his name and the title of the office. Vajra isn’t the city’s most powerful wizard, but she can hold her own. Despite her many gifts, she still questions her ability to meet the demands of her role, and she rarely makes a decision without first soliciting the advice of the _Blackstaff_, which contains Khelben Arunsun’s spirit as well as the spirits of all the other Blackstaffs who preceded her. She also gets intelligence from many other sources, both through her own network of spies and from Harper agents.\n\nVajra runs Blackstaff Academy, a school for mages, out of Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward. She is also in charge of Force Grey, an order of highly skilled adventurers who are called upon to defend the city in times of need. Vajra is always looking for new adventurers to fill the ranks of Force Grey, and she is particularly interested in those who can bring unique skills, abilities, or spells to the mix.\n\nSeveral of the older and more seasoned wizards in Waterdeep consider Vajra an upstart, but they are smart enough not to challenge her. Only the Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand, can strip Vajra of her title.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:49:35.939435852Z","tags":[]},"/Waterdeep-City-of-Splendors":{"title":"Waterdeep - City of Splendors","content":"```leaflet\nid: leaflet-map\nimage: [waterdeep](attachments/waterdeep.jpeg)\nheight: 500px\nlat: 50\nlong: 50\nminZoom: 1\nmaxZoom: 10\ndefaultZoom: 5\nunit: meters\nscale: 1\nmarker: default, 39.983334, -82.983330, [[Note]]\ndarkMode: t\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:49:35.939435852Z","tags":["maps"]},"/Zhentarim":{"title":"Zhentarim","content":"## Summary\n- A mercenary company turned gang that the [Doom Raiders](Doom%20Raiders.md) helped [Manshoon](Manshoon.md) found to fund his extremely expensive magical experiments\n\n![Pasted image 20230515212225](attachments/Zhentarim%20Banner.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:49:35.939435852Z","tags":["factions"]},"/Ziraj-the-Hunter":{"title":"Ziraj the Hunter","content":"## Summary\n- A burly half orc paladin and one of the original members of the [Doom Raiders](Doom%20Raiders.md)\n- Loyal to anyone who shows him kindness\n- Good Friends with Chad\n![](attachments/Ziraj.png)\n\n## Background\n- **Race**: Half Orc\n- **Faction**: [Doom Raiders](Doom%20Raiders.md)\n- **Abilities**: Arrow Paladin\n\n## Party Relationship\n- Party fled from Ziraj's huge arrow bolts through the city as they fled Gralhund Villa with the Stone of Golorr\n- Chad and Ziraj struck up a friendship\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:49:35.939435852Z","tags":["NPCs","Doom-Raiders"]}}
