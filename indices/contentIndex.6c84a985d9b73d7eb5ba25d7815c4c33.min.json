You may have realised that your favourite story was translated from its original language, with remnants of its mother-tongue still to spot in the text. Perhaps you were exposed to multiple languages growing up and always marvelled at how they were so similar and so different at the same time. So when you reached the age of majority, you took to studying the frameworks and building blocks of languages; not a memorisation of the words or the patterns - perhaps you never even attempted to learn them fluently! – but the structures and morphology, the shifting patchwork of how the language came to be as they are*\n\nYou find yourself fascinated with the influx of human, bestial, and abyssal languages that have flowed in to Turtle Island. You've devoted your life to the study and appreciation of it's many languages\n## Feature\n### Linguistic Pride\nYour interest in learning about languages makes you more appealing to foreigners with a strong sense of national pride, who love talking about their cultural heritage and their language (and may even insist on conducting conversations in their language). As such, you will have an easier time negotiating with and getting information from such people, to whom someone interested in their culture such as yourself seems more amenable. Work with your DM to best determine how this advantage in inter-cultural communication will express itself.\n### Alternate Feature : Natural Wordsmith\nThough linguisticians generally focus more on studying languages than learning them (in much the same way as a physician studies diseases, rather than acquires them!), their work undeniably gives them an edge in learning and utilising languages. A linguistician will find it considerably easier to adopt a different accent or dialect of a language they are familiar with, and will even be able to learn a language they are less competent with, or fake competency therein, with a slight advantage above others, if only from a cursory glance at a grammar of the language. Work with your DM to determine how this might affect deceiving other characters in speaking situations, or what advantage (if any) it will give to learning new languages.\n\n## Mechanics\n### Skill Proficiencies\n- History\n- Investigation\n### Languages\n- English\n- A second [[Languages#Colonizer Languages]]\n- A third [[Languages#Indigenous Languages]]\n### Tool Proficiencies\n### Equipment\n## Recommended Classes\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n|d8|Personality Trait|\n|---|---|\n|1|I focus more on how people say things than on what they’re actually saying.|\n|2|The first words I seek when learning about any language are the curses and obscenities.|\n|3|I can and will overuse technical vocabulary and linguistics terms.|\n|4|If you’re happy to be lectured to for hours, I am more than happy to patiently explain anything I know.|\n|5|I’m so infuriatingly tired of people assuming I learn languages; I learn _about_ them, there's a difference!|\n|6|The best way to get my attention is to shout “undeciphered text!”|\n|7|My notes are always less messy than my belongings and living space.|\n|8|Eavesdropping on conversations in foreign languages is one of my favourite pastimes.|\n\n|d6|Ideal|\n|---|---|\n|1|**Curiosity**. Learning about how others speak and understand each other is valuable in itself, without needing any other virtue attached. (Neutral)|\n|2|**Harmony**. If I understand how others express themselves and understand the world, I can help unify people across boundaries. (Good)|\n|3|**Unpredictability**. Every language understands things differently, and I revel in the thought of a world without universal rules or limitations. (Chaotic)|\n|4|**Unity**. Somewhere out there, there’s a universal system that governs how everyone conceptualises and verbalises ideas and events. (Lawful)|\n|5|**Domination**. Language affects how we view the world; perhaps with a greater mastery over language I can more easily manipulate others to my will. (Evil)|\n|6|**Self-Improvement**. Learning how other people express themselves constantly helps me examine and refine my own thoughts and behaviours. (Any)|\n\n|d6|Bond|\n|---|---|\n|1|I made a promise to my mentor to continue their unfinished work and prove that they were right after all.|\n|2|I work to increase the knowledge and standing of my academy.|\n|3|A person I cared for deeply was hurt by my words, and I’ve been searching for a way to understand how they felt.|\n|4|My community is disappearing, and all of my work is devoted to preserving its dying culture.|\n|5|I acquired my love of languages from my family.|\n|6|I admire another culture which has enriched my life in ways I can’t quite express.|\n\n|d6|Flaw|\n|---|---|\n|1|Being less shy would be helpful when speaking to foreigners. Or any other time, really.|\n|2|I’m more likely to learn about cultural taboos by blundering straight into them.|\n|3|I upset others by treating them like a study rather than a person.|\n|4|I can’t focus on one thing at a time, and I jump between them before finishing anything.|\n|5|I feel like I’ve wasted my life studying cultures instead of actually experiencing them.|\n|6|I pretend to understand far more of what other people say than I actually do.|\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T07:49:15.730123308Z","tags":[]},"/Custom-Backgrounds/The-Frontier-Psychologist":{"title":"The Frontier Psychologist","content":"## ## Lore\n*\"To come to this place voluntarily one must be mentally deficient\" - you think to yourself as you listen to the confessions of a woman who is haunted by the many she has killed.

A day came when the regular routine - the smiling faces of passers-by, tradesmen and crafters at their work, farmers tilling the fields - came to a crashing end. A great beast attacked your land and your people, and the best and bravest among you were cut down with such unbridled ferocity that many fled, and those that remained believed your final doom had arrived in the form of an array of gnashing fangs and baleful eyes.*\n\nAs the bearer of this unfortunate reputation, what specific moment or event did you decide to finally leave the place of your birth and livelihood? How have you come to deal with the insistence of total strangers that you are a hero worthy of praise, even should you insist that you aren't? Do you desire to ultimately set the record straight? Do you wish to escape to a land where you can finally be free of this nuisance? Or, perhaps, have you come to enjoy and even revel in the misconception, embellishing the existing tales as it suits your own needs, actively exploiting the fable to further your own ends?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps monster hunter is a title you take as a humble hunter of the plethora of things outside the normal range of beasts. The world has more than just bears and owls and basic creatures. There are horrid and fantastical things that require more training and expertise to trap and kill, and that is when those with your skills are called upon. You are not a hero of any special kind. You could just be some average joe doing their job like an exterminator. Sometimes the job may call for you to go elsewhere to pursue the quarry. Some monster hunters are grown from traditional practices, making them skilled in knowing how to use parts of monsters themselves to fashion things like weapons or even harvest their poisons for use.\n## Feature\nPick one of the following\n### Feature: Poison Purveyor\nLong have you immersed yourself in the meticulous study of the vile humors extracted from monsters of every stripe, and in so doing, have learned both how to carefully preserve and transport the quantities you obtain, and how to peddle your wares to the most interested and higher-paying clientele. You can readily recall the names and types of poisons and admixtures that can be created from the varieties of monster you hunt, and what quantities of given fluids and powders are needed to create such items.\n\n### Alternate Feature: Trophy Taker\nYou know how to get the most out of your prey and know what parts you can sell for money and how to collect them (meat, pelts, antlers, heads, claws, teeth, venom, special components, and so on), as well as who would most interested in buying them, allowing you to sell them for twice their normal value. You also know how to harvest and preserve any of these parts from a creatures corpse.\n\n### Alternate Feature: Hunter Senses\nYou are well adapted with your senses to pick up the traces of quarry, be it through their scat or tracks. You know the general signatures of monsters nearby, like the territorial claw marks of an owlbear, or the slime trails of oozes. You also have a knowledge of what traps go well with catching which kinds of monsters.\n## Mechanics\n### Skill Proficiencies\n- Survival\n- Nature\n### Languages\n- English\n- One additional language of your choice\n### Tool Proficiencies\n- Poisoners Kit\n- Herbalism Kit\n### Equipment\n- A set of traveler's clothes\n- a herbalism kit\n- a trophy from a monster you've killed (horn, claw fragment, etc.)\n- 5 days of rations\n- A belt pouch containing 10 gp.\n## Recommended Classes\n\n\n## Suggested Characteristics\nSpending as much time as they do among traders and eclectics, along with the isolation and duration of their forays into the deeper, darker parts of the wilds, many monster hunters bear a skewed outlook on life that is as much akin to the traits of wild animals as it is to the single-minded drive of profiteers. At the same time, many are attracted to the job, blending that rare mix of muscle and shrewd intellect that form the best (and wealthiest) of their profession.\n\n|d8|Personality Trait|\n|---|---|\n|1|I often find myself mimicking the sounds and speech of animals and monstrosities alike, consciously or not.|\n|2|I have pursued and immersed myself in the habits of my quarry so often that I have adopted some of their behaviors.|\n|3|I value the wildlife and natural world only insofar as it is valuable to me dealing with the merchant guilds.|\n|4|I am as predatory in a market exchange hawking my wares as the beasts I stalk, seeking the best price and the meekest buyer.|\n|5|It is less for the profit that I do this than it is for the thrill of the hunt and victory.|\n|6|I have learned that the most successful hunt is the one that involves skilled allies.|\n|7|It is not everyone that deserves to purchase what I procure, and I limit my offerings only to a select few.|\n|8|If you cannot keep up with me on a hunt, then you are only as good as bait for my prey.|\n\n|d6|Ideal|\n|---|---|\n|1|**Ecology** I take only what is needed to quell threats and subsist.

There was nothing. But there was a spirit in that nothingness, and it would have remained that way, but the spirit fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamed. He dreamt of a world: mountains, sky, the ocean, all of the fish in the ocean, all the birds in the sky, all the trees, the deserts, all of the animals on the earth. He dreamed of man. He dreamed of ceremony: of people drumming and singing. But then, he awoke, and because it was just a dream, everything was still black. But because the seed had been planted in him, that dream, he started to manifest it.\n\nThe first thing he did was create helpers—spirits: the grandfather of the North, the Grandfather of the East, the Grandmother of the South, and the Grandfather of the West. And they, in turn, put their dreams and thoughts into creating the Earth, the stars, the sun, and the heavens. They added their gifts, and more was created. And everything the Creator dreamed came true. And one of the last things that they did was dream a special tree—a shimmering tree. And from that root, the first man arose. The tree bent down and kissed the ground. And where it kissed the ground, the first woman came. And everything was good—everything was good and perfect, and everyone had a job from the creator.\n\nSquirrels were given the task of collecting nuts and burying them to make trees grow. Deer were sent to go through the underbrush and eat and make room so that the trees could grow. Man’s job was to take care of the earth—to be a caretaker of the land. As time went on, there was a great problem that arose among the people. There was a certain charm—it was the tooth of a giant naked bear. When you had this tooth, you could have lots of magic powers. The people started to fight each other over the tooth. They fought so hard and so long, that some of the people started moving. This is why we have different languages. But, when the creator saw what was happening, he sent a spirit being to help the people, Nanbush.\n\nNanabush went atop one of the mountains and started a fire. It was the first sacred fire that was ever made. From that fire, he sent up smoke. And all the people from all over saw that smoke, and they came to see what the smoke was. Nanabush reached down and came up with a stone. It was a soapstone. And from that soapstone he fashioned a bowl. And then he took from a branch of the sumac tree. He made a stem and fashioned that and put that together with the bowl. Then he reached down and the creator gave him a sacred plant. And they called it tobacco. Nanapush held that pipe up and told the people, \"Whenever there’s discord, whenever you hold council, whenever you want to come together, and bring you minds together as one, take this tobacco, put it in a pipe, and smoke it. And that smoke will go into you and when you blow it out your thoughts your prayers will all intermingle together. And you’ll be able to make decisions that are right for everyone and everything.\n\nNanapush comes back into our stories a lot. One of them is an emergence story. As I told you before the people originally started fighting over the tooth of that naked bear but what happened was there was some evil spirits here. One of them was a giant toad. He was in charge of all the waters. There was also a giant snake. They started fighting over that tooth and the great frog ate the snake and ate the tooth. The snake jabbed him in the side and all those waters started coming out in a big flood. Nanapush again came and he saw everything was being destroyed. He came upon a mountain and he started gathering all the animals and sticking them in a sash. Eventually he got to the top of this mountain and there was a cedar tree. He started climbing the tree. As he climbed, he would snap cedar bows off and stick them in his belt. He got to the top and what he did was he took his bow and started plucking on his bow and he sang a song and all the waters stopped rising. Then Nanapush asked of the animals, who will let me put all the cedar branches on top of you so that all the animals can go on top of you? And the turtle said, you can put them on me and I’ll float on the water and you can put the branches on me. So they did. That’s why we call this land turtle island.\n\nThen Nanapush said, “Well, we gotta make it a little bigger than it is—turtle’s only so big, even a snapping turtle’s only so big—so they had to go down and get some of the old earth under the water and put it up on top of the turtle. So first guy that goes down, the beaver, says I’m gonna go down. Beaver went all the way down. He comes up dead with no soil. Nanapush breathes some more life into him and brought him back to life. Then the bird nation came up and the loon said, \" I wanna go down. I wanna go down and see if I can do it.\" Loon went down; he was down for a long time. He came back up dead. So Nanapush breathed into him. So finally the little bitty muskrat said, Let me try.\" So he went down. And poor little muskrat, he was down for the longest time, and he come up dead, but on his nose was some of the old earth. So he breathed into the little muskrat and they put the earth on the back of the turtle. And he told the muskrat he would always be blessed and his kind would always thrive in this land.\n\nThen Nanapush took his bow out again and started singing a song. And as he sang the turtle’s back grew and grew so much that you couldn’t even see from one end to the other anymore. And it kept growing. Nanapush says I wonder how long we should let this turtle grow. I’m gonna send out each of the animals. He sent the bear out. Bear came back 2-3 days later and said, “OK I got to the edge.” He sent the deer out. Deer came back two weeks later and said, “I made it to the edge.” Finally they sent the wolf. The wolf went. They waited for the wolf to come back. They waited months. They waited years. The wolf didn’t come back. That’s how big the land got. In fact to this day wolves at night will often howl, and what they’re howling for is they’re calling for their ancestor who went off to see if he can find his way back home again. That’s the story of how the earth was first made and how the first pipe came to our people and how the first flood came and we re-emerged from the flood.\n\n[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144555/http://www.lenapenation.org/Lenape%20Lixsewakan%20Achimawakana/The%20Lenape%20Creation%20Story.pdf)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T07:49:15.734123369Z","tags":[]},"/Worldbuilding/Worldbuilding-Inspiration":{"title":"World Inspiration","content":"## Books\n- Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy\n\t- Heavy content warning, this book is fucking brutal, but it is one of the \"Great American Novel\" candidates\n- Empire of the Summer Moon by S.C.
