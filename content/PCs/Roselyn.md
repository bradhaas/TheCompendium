You mentioned you were interested in playing an Amish type character on rumspringa - here are some class ideas that give me that general vibe (although with that character concept you can really make anything work)


### [Sorcerer - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer)
- [Sorcerer: Wild Magic - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:wild-magic)
	- You're a sorcerer who has touched some wild chaotic force - whenever you cast a spell you roll on a table for wild magic surges
	
### [Barbarian - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian)
- [Barbarian: Path of Wild Magic - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:wild-magic)
	- Similar to wild magic sorcerer, but you're a raging barbarian who can cast some spells
- [Barbarian: Path of the Ancestral Guardian - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:ancestral-guardian)

### [Cleric - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric)
- [Cleric: Trickery Domain - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:trickery)
	- You're tricky - sneaky, disguises, mirror self, etc.
