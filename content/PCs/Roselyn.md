You mentioned you were interested in playing an Amish type character on rumspringa - here are some class ideas that give me that general vibe (although with that character concept you can really make anything work).

In no order:

### [Druid - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/druid)
- [Druid: Circle of Dreams - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/druid:dreams)
	- You could be on a rumspringa 

### [Sorcerer - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer)
- [Sorcerer: Wild Magic - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:wild-magic)
	- You're a sorcerer who has touched some wild chaotic force - whenever you cast a spell you roll on a table for wild magic surges
- [Sorcerer: Draconic Bloodline - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:draconic-bloodline)

### [Barbarian - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian)

	- You accept an animal spiritual guide who helps you in your journey

### [Cleric - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric)
- [Cleric: Order Domain - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:order)
	- Your domain focuses on order and devotion to laws 
- [Cleric: Trickery Domain - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:trickery)
	- You're tricky - sneaky, disguises, mirror self, etc.
