## Summary
An archwizard who hired the [Doom Raiders](Factions/Doom%20Raiders.md)' mercenary group *The Black Network* in order to found the [Zhentarim](Factions/Zhentarim.md)

Like many wizards pushing the boundaries of magical experiments, [Manshoon](NPCs/Manshoon.md) eventually ran in the very non-magical problem of resources. Spellcasting components aren't cheap, particularly when your research focuses in creating life and manipulating time.
