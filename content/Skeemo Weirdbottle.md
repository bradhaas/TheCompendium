## Summary
- Skeemo became the Master of Magic for the [Zhentarim](content/Zhentarim.md), setting up a cover in the Trades Ward in the form of a cramped little shop called Weirdbottleâ€™s Concoctions.
- Most of his potions and elixirs are nonmagical, but he crafts magical ones for his Zhent friends.
