## Books
- Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy
	- Heavy content warning, this book is fucking brutal, but it is one of the "Great American Novel" candidates
- Empire of the Summer Moon by S.C. Gwynne
	- Historical account of the war between the Comanche Nation and European Settlers
- Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry
	- Pulitzer winning "Cowboy Novel", although from the 80s so still some problematic themese
	- Tommy Lee Jones starred in a very well regarded TV adaptation
- Undaunted Courage by Stephen E. Ambrose
	- Definitive account of Lewis and Clark + Corps of Discovery

## Video Games
- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Fallout New Vegas

## TTRPGs
- **Coyote and Crow** - a super cool TTRPG made by a team of Native game designers - also alternate history, but instead one where colonizers never made it to the new world
	- They also put out a ton of ancillary material linked below that is cool / interesting if you're interested in Native culture
