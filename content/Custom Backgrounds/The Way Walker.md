## Lore
*You feel along the seam of this dimension looking for weak points. To your surprise, you actually find one. A small nodule in space, barely noticeable, but to someone with your training there plain as day. You push on it slightly. Widen it. You feel yourself pushing against the natural order as you attempt to force open a way between this world and one beyond. You see a bright light start to permeate through the fabric of reality as you feel sweat bead on your brow. As soon as you feel a rush of excitement, the gap snaps shut. You feel your heart fall. You spent several days tracking magical beasts and farie fire to this point, and just like that it's gone. Oh well. On to the next one.*

You were raised on stories of other worlds. Your master, or clan, made it clear that magic is really just our world touching one beyond. These days it feels harder and harder to touch this magic - but nevertheless you persereve. After all - who can resist the limitless power that lies on the other side of that rift?
