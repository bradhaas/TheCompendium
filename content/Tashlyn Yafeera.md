## Background
- Tashlyn has established a useful cover by serving as a bodyguard to Vorondar Levelstone, a dwarf magister stationed at the South Gate.
	- She likes the dwarf and has earned his confidence, allowing her to reach the rank of captain in the City Guard.
	- In that position, she watches over traffic that passes through the gate — and ensures that her associates in the Black Network can come and go freely.
- Born to a well-off family in Calimshan, Tashlyn has an unfettered sense of superiority. Quick to anger, she hates to back down from a fight. She respects anyone who can best her in melee combat.
