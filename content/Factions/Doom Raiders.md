- An adventuring party that made a name for themselves cleaning out the lairs of liches (known as "dooms").
- As they sought more power, they eventually allied themselves with the wizard [[NPCs/Manshoon]]
	- Together, they formed what became the [[Factions/Zhentarim]]
	- They acted as the generals of the Mercenary Group
- Skeemo grew frustrated with their stagnant role as enforcers in a crime family - he made a play with [[NPCs/Manshoon]] to take the city over, stabbing his old friends in the back on the way
