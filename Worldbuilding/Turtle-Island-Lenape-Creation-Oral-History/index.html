There was nothing. But there was a spirit in that nothingness, and it would have remained that way, but the spirit fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamed. He dreamt of a world: mountains, sky, the ocean, all of the fish in the ocean, all the birds in the sky, all the trees, the deserts, all of the animals on the earth. He dreamed of man. He dreamed of ceremony: of people drumming and singing. But then, he awoke, and because it was just a dream, everything was still black. But because the seed had been planted in him, that dream, he started to manifest it.</p><p>The first thing he did was create helpers‚Äîspirits: the grandfather of the North, the Grandfather of the East, the Grandmother of the South, and the Grandfather of the West. And they, in turn, put their dreams and thoughts into creating the Earth, the stars, the sun, and the heavens. They added their gifts, and more was created. And everything the Creator dreamed came true. And one of the last things that they did was dream a special tree‚Äîa shimmering tree. And from that root, the first man arose. The tree bent down and kissed the ground. And where it kissed the ground, the first woman came. And everything was good‚Äîeverything was good and perfect, and everyone had a job from the creator.</p><p>Squirrels were given the task of collecting nuts and burying them to make trees grow. Deer were sent to go through the underbrush and eat and make room so that the trees could grow. Man‚Äôs job was to take care of the earth‚Äîto be a caretaker of the land. As time went on, there was a great problem that arose among the people. There was a certain charm‚Äîit was the tooth of a giant naked bear. When you had this tooth, you could have lots of magic powers. The people started to fight each other over the tooth. They fought so hard and so long, that some of the people started moving. This is why we have different languages. But, when the creator saw what was happening, he sent a spirit being to help the people, Nanbush.</p><p>Nanabush went atop one of the mountains and started a fire. It was the first sacred fire that was ever made. From that fire, he sent up smoke. And all the people from all over saw that smoke, and they came to see what the smoke was. Nanabush reached down and came up with a stone. It was a soapstone. And from that soapstone he fashioned a bowl. And then he took from a branch of the sumac tree. He made a stem and fashioned that and put that together with the bowl. Then he reached down and the creator gave him a sacred plant. And they called it tobacco. Nanapush held that pipe up and told the people, &ldquo;Whenever there‚Äôs discord, whenever you hold council, whenever you want to come together, and bring you minds together as one, take this tobacco, put it in a pipe, and smoke it. And that smoke will go into you and when you blow it out your thoughts your prayers will all intermingle together. And you‚Äôll be able to make decisions that are right for everyone and everything.</p><p>Nanapush comes back into our stories a lot. One of them is an emergence story. As I told you before the people originally started fighting over the tooth of that naked bear but what happened was there was some evil spirits here. One of them was a giant toad. He was in charge of all the waters. There was also a giant snake. They started fighting over that tooth and the great frog ate the snake and ate the tooth. The snake jabbed him in the side and all those waters started coming out in a big flood. Nanapush again came and he saw everything was being destroyed. He came upon a mountain and he started gathering all the animals and sticking them in a sash. Eventually he got to the top of this mountain and there was a cedar tree. He started climbing the tree. As he climbed, he would snap cedar bows off and stick them in his belt. He got to the top and what he did was he took his bow and started plucking on his bow and he sang a song and all the waters stopped rising. Then Nanapush asked of the animals, who will let me put all the cedar branches on top of you so that all the animals can go on top of you? And the turtle said, you can put them on me and I‚Äôll float on the water and you can put the branches on me. So they did. That‚Äôs why we call this land turtle island.</p><p>Then Nanapush said, ‚ÄúWell, we gotta make it a little bigger than it is‚Äîturtle‚Äôs only so big, even a snapping turtle‚Äôs only so big‚Äîso they had to go down and get some of the old earth under the water and put it up on top of the turtle. So first guy that goes down, the beaver, says I‚Äôm gonna go down. Beaver went all the way down. He comes up dead with no soil. Nanapush breathes some more life into him and brought him back to life. Then the bird nation came up and the loon said, " I wanna go down. I wanna go down and see if I can do it.&rdquo; Loon went down; he was down for a long time. He came back up dead. So Nanapush breathed into him. So finally the little bitty muskrat said, Let me try." So he went down. And poor little muskrat, he was down for the longest time, and he come up dead, but on his nose was some of the old earth. So he breathed into the little muskrat and they put the earth on the back of the turtle. And he told the muskrat he would always be blessed and his kind would always thrive in this land.</p><p>Then Nanapush took his bow out again and started singing a song. And as he sang the turtle‚Äôs back grew and grew so much that you couldn‚Äôt even see from one end to the other anymore. And it kept growing. Nanapush says I wonder how long we should let this turtle grow. I‚Äôm gonna send out each of the animals. He sent the bear out. Bear came back 2-3 days later and said, ‚ÄúOK I got to the edge.‚Äù He sent the deer out. Deer came back two weeks later and said, ‚ÄúI made it to the edge.‚Äù Finally they sent the wolf. The wolf went. They waited for the wolf to come back. They waited months. They waited years. The wolf didn‚Äôt come back. That‚Äôs how big the land got. In fact to this day wolves at night will often howl, and what they‚Äôre howling for is they‚Äôre calling for their ancestor who went off to see if he can find his way back home again. That‚Äôs the story of how the earth was first made and how the first pipe came to our people and how the first flood came and we re-emerged from the flood.</p><p><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144555/http://www.lenapenation.org/Lenape-Lixsewakan-Achimawakana/The-Lenape-Creation-Story.pdf rel=noopener>Source</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/TheCompendium// data-ctx="Turtle Island (Lenape Creation Oral History)" data-src=/ class=internal-link>_index</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://bradhaas.github.io/TheCompendium/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Brad Haas using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://bradhaas.github.io/TheCompendium/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://owlbear.rodeo>Owlbear</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
